Description: This is Toba, a Java bytecode to C compiler.  It "tobafies" every
classfile in the soot-j benchmark.  The soot-j classfiles are covered
by the LGPL license (see the soot-j benchmark.)  This benchmark was set up
to run properly under JDK1.2 under Linux.  Because of the way that Toba
builds signatures based on class properties, running it under another
system probably will fail.
