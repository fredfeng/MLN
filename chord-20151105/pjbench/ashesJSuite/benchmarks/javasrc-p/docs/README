Javasrc: v1.4.2
http://keith.johnston.net/javasrc.htm

Instructions
============

java -cp javasrc.jar -Dtitle=<title -Doutdir=<doc dir> javasrc.app.JavaSrc <sourcedir,sourcedir,...>

javasrc will recursively descend the source dir, looking for java
files to parse.

If you run out of memory, try adding the flag "-Xmx180m" (for 180 megs).
Keep increasing the memory size until it works.

The output will be the same top-level files as you would find with the
output of javadoc.  The main file "index.html" is the first file you should
view.

The source files are renamed as *_java.html.  For each of these, a 
references file is generated *_java_ref.html.  The source files and
reference files are placed in the package directory for that
file, relative to the docdir specified on the command line.

Clicking on a definition (class or method) takes you to the 
reference page where all the references to that definition.  Clicking
on a reference takes you to the definition.

Modifying the Colors
====================
Cascading Style Sheets are used to define the colors for the comments
and line numbers.  You can change these by modifying the styles.css
file in the main directory.

Modifying the Code
==================
If you want to change the parser, modify java.g in javasrc/xref,
and then run "java -cp javasrc.jar antlr.Tool java.g".  This will 
generate the JavaLexer, JavaTokenTypes, and JavaXref classes.
